                                    Yves Moreau is a professor at the University of Leuven, Belgium. His team develops machine learning methods for clinical genetics and drug discovery: (1) privacy-preserving analysis of clinical genetic data, (2) data fusion algorithms for the identification of candidate disease genes and variants in rare genetic disorders, and (3) data fusion for drug discovery and drug design. Methodologically, he focuses on the development of novel artificial intelligence methods (Bayesian matrix factorization and deep learning) for the fusion of heterogeneous, sparsely observed data, and on privacy-preserving implementations of such methods. He aims at demonstrated clinical or industrial applicability of those methods and proven effectiveness in human genetics research and drug discovery. He is a tech innovator interested in identifying relevant business models for emerging technologies and developing projects up to the precompetitive stage and the startup of university spin-offs. He was a co-founder of Data4S, a data mining company specialized in fraud detection and anti-moneylaundering, which is now part of BAE Systems. He was also a co-founder of Cartagenia, specialized in ICT solutions for clinical genetic diagnosis, now part of Agilent Technologies. He is also engaged in a reflection on how information technology and artificial intelligence are transforming our world and on how to make sure this transformation is beneficial for all.

                                    Explaining the predictions of modern black-box machine learning systems is essential for the development of trustworthy artificial intelligence. In this talk we will discuss counterfactual explanations (counterfactuals), which provides information about how the description of an example should be changed in order to obtain a more desired prediction of the machine learning model. In order to generate a good counterfactual, several desirable properties are formulated, such as the validity of the decision change, its proximity to the input instance, the sparsity of the recommended changes, its actionability, its plausibility and others The talk will cover recent author’s works on handling plausible counterfactuals, and ongoing research on robust explanations to model changes. The final part of this talk will address selected open research questions and challenges.

                                    Due to the significant impact of recommendations on users’ experiences and the often sensitive nature of recommendation tasks, it is crucial to carefully design the processes by which recommendations are generated. This has led to a growing emphasis on developing recommender systems that adhere to key principles of responsibility, such as fairness—ensuring the absence of bias—and transparency—enhancing user understanding of system decisions. In this talk, we will present a toolkit of definitions, models, and methods for promoting fairness in recommender systems, with a special focus on group recommendations. Additionally, since users may struggle to comprehend why a particular suggestion is made, many systems incorporate explanations to improve transparency. We will discuss different types of explanations in recommender systems, including why-not and counterfactual explanations, both for individual users and groups.

                                    Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX), redefining design principles and transforming human-AI relationships. Yet, trust remains a critical challenge, users hesitate to trust what they don't understand. While transparency in algorithmic processes and decision-making is essential for building confidence, a fundamental question persists: How can we make complex AI systems truly accessible and relatable, particularly for non-experts? This talk embraces an innovative approach through visual storytelling, bridging the gap between AI's technical complexities and human understanding. We present an academic graphic novel that reveals the hidden world of algorithms, networks, and logical decision-making. The narrative follows Agent Black, an AI entity that mimics human behavior, as it navigates decentralized digital landscapes to complete a seemingly simple task: finding the perfect birthday venue. By anthropomorphizing AI's challenges, including ethical dilemmas, computational constraints, and decision-making processes, we transform abstract concepts into tangible human experiences. Combining humor, narrative tension, and expert insights, the graphic novel turns computational logic into an engaging and intuitive journey. Ultimately, this talk explores how HCI and UX can reshape AI's future as a trustworthy, comprehensible partner in our daily lives.
